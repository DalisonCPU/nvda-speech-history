## Changes for 2022.1.2-dev ##
## Changes for speech history dialog:

* now the search is executed when the field search loses focus. E.G, by pressing tab key. You still can press enter if you want.
* added a button to clear the entire history in the dialog and in the global add-on.
* added a button to refresh the history.
* some gui redesigns.
* fix, now the text field that shows the current item, is properly asociated and is empty if no one item is focused.
* updated readme and some code GUI strings.
